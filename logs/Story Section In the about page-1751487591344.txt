As a founder and people-facing professional himself, he watched countless hours vanish into writing replies, managing follow-ups, and organizing scattered knowledge. He didn’t need a better email app. He needed an actual assistant. But for most solo professionals and small teams, that kind of help just wasn’t accessible.\n\nSo he set out to build it—creating Serif as a true executive assistant powered by AI.

Serif auto-drafts emails in seconds, understands long threads, and adapts to your tone. Powered by your business context and preferences—not generic AI.\n\nOver 1 million emails sent through Serif, with minimal edits required.\n\n---\n\nYour business, out of your head\n\nSerif learns your workflows, SOPs, products, customer stories, and priorities—and makes them instantly usable. From who's who, to what needs doing—Serif remembers it all and acts on it for you.\n\n- Auto-labeling and triage that actually works  \n- Persistent knowledge base that never drops the ball  \n- Handles multi-turn conversations on your behalf with full context\n\n---\n\nAll signal, no clutter\n\nSerif doesn’t just draft emails—it helps you focus on the ones that matter. Smart labeling and custom filters surface high-value conversations. Everything else waits its turn.\n\nHelp your team focus, close deals faster, and spend less time buried in inbox chaos.\n\n---\n\nRun a business. Not an inbox.\n\nEmail is just the start. Serif helps professionals across industries stay on top of operations—automating communication, tracking deals, supporting follow-up, building shared knowledge, and more.\n\nOne person plus Serif equals enterprise power.\n\n- Built-in executive memory and correction-based learning  \n- Collaborative workflows for teams and scaling agencies  \n- Custom pipelines, labels, and automation for any business case\n\n---\n\nPrivacy built-in\n\nYour data never trains broad AI models.

As a founder and people-facing professional himself, he watched countless hours vanish into writing replies, managing follow-ups, and organizing scattered knowledge. He didn’t need a better email app. He needed an actual assistant. But for most solo professionals and small teams, that kind of help just wasn’t accessible.\n\nSo he set out to build it—creating Serif as a true executive assistant powered by AI. One that could understand your business, draft emails, handle back-and-forths, and free up your schedule. In just 5 months, Serif grew to $400K ARR, powered by an unheard-of 59% email acceptance rate and 83.8% month-one retention. Serif worked—and people started telling others.

Reply faster. Grow more.\n\nSerif is your AI-powered executive assistant—built to handle your busiest inbox, remember your playbook, and keep your deals moving.\n\n---\n\nEmail that writes itself\n\nNo more hours lost writing and rewriting replies. Serif auto-drafts emails in seconds, understands long threads, and adapts to your tone. Powered by your business context and preferences—not generic AI.\n\nOver 1 million emails sent through Serif, with minimal edits required.\n\n---\n\nYour business, out of your head\n\nSerif learns your workflows, SOPs, products, customer stories, and priorities—and makes them instantly usable. From who's who, to what needs doing—Serif remembers it all and acts on it for you.\n\n- Auto-labeling and triage that actually works  \n- Persistent knowledge base that never drops the ball  \n- Handles multi-turn conversations on your behalf with full context\n\n---\n\nAll signal, no clutter\n\nSerif doesn’t just draft emails—it helps you focus on the ones that matter. Smart labeling and custom filters surface high-value conversations. Everything else waits its turn.\n\nHelp your team focus, close deals faster, and spend less time buried in inbox chaos.\n\n---\n\nRun a business. Not an inbox.\n\nEmail is just the start. Serif helps professionals across industries stay on top of operations—automating communication, tracking deals, supporting follow-up, building shared knowledge, and more.\n\nOne person plus Serif equals enterprise power.\n\n- Built-in executive memory and correction-based learning  \n- Collaborative workflows for teams and scaling agencies  \n- Custom pipelines, labels, and automation for any business case\n\n---\n\nPrivacy built-in\n\nYour data never trains broad AI models. We never store your emails on our servers. The assistant learns and remembers on your behalf—with context encrypted at rest and strict data protections in place.\n\nSerif is CASA Tier 2 accredited. SOC 2 Type 2, GDPR, and HIPAA compliance is in progress through Vanta.\n\n---\n\nReal professionals. Real results.\n\nTop brokers, founders, and sales teams already rely on Serif.  \n\n- Assort Health: saved 190+ hours monthly and closed deals 9% faster  \n- Land Geek: 2+ hours saved every day  \n- Harry’s agency: doubled close speed with less admin time  \n- OpenArt teams: shifted 95% of attention back to core product work\n\n---\n\nPlug and play\n\nWorks right where you already are—Gmail, Outlook, and your team’s everyday workflows. Fully integrated, fully yours.\n\n---\n\nReady to stop dreading email?\n\nStart your free trial and regain hours every week.\n\nStart free trial\n\n---\n\nFrom problem to product\n\nKevin started Serif with a simple but urgent problem—email was eating his days alive. As a founder and people-facing professional himself, he watched countless hours vanish into writing replies, managing follow-ups, and organizing scattered knowledge. He didn’t need a better email app. He needed an actual assistant. But for most solo professionals and small teams, that kind of help just wasn’t accessible.\n\nSo he set out to build it—creating Serif as a true executive assistant powered by AI. One that could understand your business, draft emails, handle back-and-forths, and free up your schedule. In just 5 months, Serif grew to $400K ARR, powered by an unheard-of 59% email acceptance rate and 83.8% month-one retention. Serif worked—and people started telling others. The viral word of mouth filled early growth without burning a single marketing dollar on paid ads.\n\nNow, Serif powers thousands of inboxes across industries—from the country’s top business broker to fast-growing agencies and B2B sales teams. Customers have sent over 1 million emails with Serif, making only light edits before hitting send. And they’re saving hundreds of hours every week getting out of email and back to running their business.

Reply faster. Grow more.\n\nSerif is your AI-powered executive assistant—built to handle your busiest inbox, remember your playbook, and keep your deals moving.\n\n---\n\nEmail that writes itself\n\nNo more hours lost writing and rewriting replies. Serif auto-drafts emails in seconds, understands long threads, and adapts to your tone. Powered by your business context and preferences—not generic AI.\n\nOver 1 million emails sent through Serif, with minimal edits required.\n\n---\n\nYour business, out of your head\n\nSerif learns your workflows, SOPs, products, customer stories, and priorities—and makes them instantly usable. From who's who, to what needs doing—Serif remembers it all and acts on it for you.\n\n- Auto-labeling and triage that actually works  \n- Persistent knowledge base that never drops the ball  \n- Handles multi-turn conversations on your behalf with full context\n\n---\n\nAll signal, no clutter\n\nSerif doesn’t just draft emails—it helps you focus on the ones that matter. Smart labeling and custom filters surface high-value conversations. Everything else waits its turn.\n\nHelp your team focus, close deals faster, and spend less time buried in inbox chaos.\n\n---\n\nRun a business. Not an inbox.\n\nEmail is just the start. Serif helps professionals across industries stay on top of operations—automating communication, tracking deals, supporting follow-up, building shared knowledge, and more.\n\nOne person plus Serif equals enterprise power.\n\n- Built-in executive memory and correction-based learning  \n- Collaborative workflows for teams and scaling agencies  \n- Custom pipelines, labels, and automation for any business case\n\n---\n\nPrivacy built-in\n\nYour data never trains broad AI models. We never store your emails on our servers. The assistant learns and remembers on your behalf—with context encrypted at rest and strict data protections in place.\n\nSerif is CASA Tier 2 accredited. SOC 2 Type 2, GDPR, and HIPAA compliance is in progress through Vanta.\n\n---\n\nReal professionals. Real results.\n\nTop brokers, founders, and sales teams already rely on Serif.  \n\n- Assort Health: saved 190+ hours monthly and closed deals 9% faster  \n- Land Geek: 2+ hours saved every day  \n- Harry’s agency: doubled close speed with less admin time  \n- OpenArt teams: shifted 95% of attention back to core product work\n\n---\n\nPlug and play\n\nWorks right where you already are—Gmail, Outlook, and your team’s everyday workflows.

As a founder and people-facing professional himself, he watched countless hours vanish into writing replies, managing follow-ups, and organizing scattered knowledge. He didn’t need a better email app. He needed an actual assistant. But for most solo professionals and small teams, that kind of help just wasn’t accessible.\n\nSo he set out to build it—creating Serif as a true executive assistant powered by AI. One that could understand your business, draft emails, handle back-and-forths, and free up your schedule. In just 5 months, Serif grew to $400K ARR, powered by an unheard-of 59% email acceptance rate and 83.8% month-one retention. Serif worked—and people started telling others. The viral word of mouth filled early growth without burning a single marketing dollar on paid ads.\n\nNow, Serif powers thousands of inboxes across industries—from the country’s top business broker to fast-growing agencies and B2B sales teams. Customers have sent over 1 million emails with Serif, making only light edits before hitting send. And they’re saving hundreds of hours every week getting out of email and back to running their business.

As a founder and people-facing professional himself, he watched countless hours vanish into writing replies, managing follow-ups, and organizing scattered knowledge. He didn’t need a better email app. He needed an actual assistant. But for most solo professionals and small teams, that kind of help just wasn’t accessible.\n\nSo he set out to build it—creating Serif as a true executive assistant powered by AI.

Reply faster. Grow more.\n\nSerif is your AI-powered executive assistant—built to handle your busiest inbox, remember your playbook, and keep your deals moving.\n\n---\n\nEmail that writes itself\n\nNo more hours lost writing and rewriting replies. Serif auto-drafts emails in seconds, understands long threads, and adapts to your tone. Powered by your business context and preferences—not generic AI.\n\nOver 1 million emails sent through Serif, with minimal edits required.\n\n---\n\nYour business, out of your head\n\nSerif learns your workflows, SOPs, products, customer stories, and priorities—and makes them instantly usable. From who's who, to what needs doing—Serif remembers it all and acts on it for you.\n\n- Auto-labeling and triage that actually works  \n- Persistent knowledge base that never drops the ball  \n- Handles multi-turn conversations on your behalf with full context\n\n---\n\nAll signal, no clutter\n\nSerif doesn’t just draft emails—it helps you focus on the ones that matter. Smart labeling and custom filters surface high-value conversations. Everything else waits its turn.\n\nHelp your team focus, close deals faster, and spend less time buried in inbox chaos.\n\n---\n\nRun a business. Not an inbox.\n\nEmail is just the start. Serif helps professionals across industries stay on top of operations—automating communication, tracking deals, supporting follow-up, building shared knowledge, and more.\n\nOne person plus Serif equals enterprise power.\n\n- Built-in executive memory and correction-based learning  \n- Collaborative workflows for teams and scaling agencies  \n- Custom pipelines, labels, and automation for any business case\n\n---\n\nPrivacy built-in\n\nYour data never trains broad AI models. We never store your emails on our servers. The assistant learns and remembers on your behalf—with context encrypted at rest and strict data protections in place.\n\nSerif is CASA Tier 2 accredited. SOC 2 Type 2, GDPR, and HIPAA compliance is in progress through Vanta.\n\n---\n\nReal professionals. Real results.\n\nTop brokers, founders, and sales teams already rely on Serif.  \n\n- Assort Health: saved 190+ hours monthly and closed deals 9% faster  \n- Land Geek: 2+ hours saved every day  \n- Harry’s agency: doubled close speed with less admin time  \n- OpenArt teams: shifted 95% of attention back to core product work\n\n---\n\nPlug and play\n\nWorks right where you already are—Gmail, Outlook, and your team’s everyday workflows. Fully integrated, fully yours.\n\n---\n\nReady to stop dreading email?\n\nStart your free trial and regain hours every week.\n\nStart free trial\n\n---\n\nFrom problem to product\n\nKevin started Serif with a simple but urgent problem—email was eating his days alive. As a founder and people-facing professional himself, he watched countless hours vanish into writing replies, managing follow-ups, and organizing scattered knowledge. He didn’t need a better email app. He needed an actual assistant. But for most solo professionals and small teams, that kind of help just wasn’t accessible.\n\nSo he set out to build it—creating Serif as a true executive assistant powered by AI. One that could understand your business, draft emails, handle back-and-forths, and free up your schedule. In just 5 months, Serif grew to $400K ARR, powered by an unheard-of 59% email acceptance rate and 83.8% month-one retention. Serif worked—and people started telling others. The viral word of mouth filled early growth without burning a single marketing dollar on paid ads.\n\nNow, Serif powers thousands of inboxes across industries—from the country’s top business broker to fast-growing agencies and B2B sales teams. Customers have sent over 1 million emails with Serif, making only light edits before hitting send. And they’re saving hundreds of hours every week getting out of email and back to running their business.

Reply faster. Grow more.\n\nSerif is your AI-powered executive assistant—built to handle your busiest inbox, remember your playbook, and keep your deals moving.\n\n---\n\nEmail that writes itself\n\nNo more hours lost writing and rewriting replies. Serif auto-drafts emails in seconds, understands long threads, and adapts to your tone. Powered by your business context and preferences—not generic AI.\n\nOver 1 million emails sent through Serif, with minimal edits required.\n\n---\n\nYour business, out of your head\n\nSerif learns your workflows, SOPs, products, customer stories, and priorities—and makes them instantly usable. From who's who, to what needs doing—Serif remembers it all and acts on it for you.\n\n- Auto-labeling and triage that actually works  \n- Persistent knowledge base that never drops the ball  \n- Handles multi-turn conversations on your behalf with full context\n\n---\n\nAll signal, no clutter\n\nSerif doesn’t just draft emails—it helps you focus on the ones that matter. Smart labeling and custom filters surface high-value conversations. Everything else waits its turn.\n\nHelp your team focus, close deals faster, and spend less time buried in inbox chaos.\n\n---\n\nRun a business. Not an inbox.\n\nEmail is just the start. Serif helps professionals across industries stay on top of operations—automating communication, tracking deals, supporting follow-up, building shared knowledge, and more.\n\nOne person plus Serif equals enterprise power.\n\n- Built-in executive memory and correction-based learning  \n- Collaborative workflows for teams and scaling agencies  \n- Custom pipelines, labels, and automation for any business case\n\n---\n\nPrivacy built-in\n\nYour data never trains broad AI models. We never store your emails on our servers. The assistant learns and remembers on your behalf—with context encrypted at rest and strict data protections in place.\n\nSerif is CASA Tier 2 accredited. SOC 2 Type 2, GDPR, and HIPAA compliance is in progress through Vanta.\n\n---\n\nReal professionals. Real results.\n\nTop brokers, founders, and sales teams already rely on Serif.  \n\n- Assort Health: saved 190+ hours monthly and closed deals 9% faster  \n- Land Geek: 2+ hours saved every day  \n- Harry’s agency: doubled close speed with less admin time  \n- OpenArt teams: shifted 95% of attention back to core product work\n\n---\n\nPlug and play\n\nWorks right where you already are—Gmail, Outlook, and your team’s everyday workflows. Fully integrated, fully yours.\n\n---\n\nReady to stop dreading email?\n\nStart your free trial and regain hours every week.\n\nStart free trial\n\n---\n\nFrom problem to product\n\nKevin started Serif with a simple but urgent problem—email was eating his days alive. As a founder and people-facing professional himself, he watched countless hours vanish into writing replies, managing follow-ups, and organizing scattered knowledge. He didn’t need a better email app. He needed an actual assistant. But for most solo professionals and small teams, that kind of help just wasn’t accessible.\n\nSo he set out to build it—creating Serif as a true executive assistant powered by AI. One that could understand your business, draft emails, handle back-and-forths, and free up your schedule. In just 5 months, Serif grew to $400K ARR, powered by an unheard-of 59% email acceptance rate and 83.8% month-one retention. Serif worked—and people started telling others. The viral word of mouth filled early growth without burning a single marketing dollar on paid ads.\n\nNow, Serif powers thousands of inboxes across industries—from the country’s top business broker to fast-growing agencies and B2B sales teams. Customers have sent over 1 million emails with Serif, making only light edits before hitting send. And they’re saving hundreds of hours every week getting out of email and back to running their business. For Kevin, the vision stays the same: make inboxes feel lighter, make decisions faster, and help people finally achieve true email freedom."}]},{"role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"text","text":"Perfect!

Reply faster. Grow more.\n\nSerif is your AI-powered executive assistant—built to handle your busiest inbox, remember your playbook, and keep your deals moving.\n\n---\n\nEmail that writes itself\n\nNo more hours lost writing and rewriting replies. Serif auto-drafts emails in seconds, understands long threads, and adapts to your tone. Powered by your business context and preferences—not generic AI.\n\nOver 1 million emails sent through Serif, with minimal edits required.\n\n---\n\nYour business, out of your head\n\nSerif learns your workflows, SOPs, products, customer stories, and priorities—and makes them instantly usable. From who's who, to what needs doing—Serif remembers it all and acts on it for you.\n\n- Auto-labeling and triage that actually works  \n- Persistent knowledge base that never drops the ball  \n- Handles multi-turn conversations on your behalf with full context\n\n---\n\nAll signal, no clutter\n\nSerif doesn’t just draft emails—it helps you focus on the ones that matter. Smart labeling and custom filters surface high-value conversations. Everything else waits its turn.\n\nHelp your team focus, close deals faster, and spend less time buried in inbox chaos.\n\n---\n\nRun a business. Not an inbox.\n\nEmail is just the start. Serif helps professionals across industries stay on top of operations—automating communication, tracking deals, supporting follow-up, building shared knowledge, and more.\n\nOne person plus Serif equals enterprise power.\n\n- Built-in executive memory and correction-based learning  \n- Collaborative workflows for teams and scaling agencies  \n- Custom pipelines, labels, and automation for any business case\n\n---\n\nPrivacy built-in\n\nYour data never trains broad AI models. We never store your emails on our servers. The assistant learns and remembers on your behalf—with context encrypted at rest and strict data protections in place.\n\nSerif is CASA Tier 2 accredited. SOC 2 Type 2, GDPR, and HIPAA compliance is in progress through Vanta.\n\n---\n\nReal professionals. Real results.\n\nTop brokers, founders, and sales teams already rely on Serif.  \n\n- Assort Health: saved 190+ hours monthly and closed deals 9% faster  \n- Land Geek: 2+ hours saved every day  \n- Harry’s agency: doubled close speed with less admin time  \n- OpenArt teams: shifted 95% of attention back to core product work\n\n---\n\nPlug and play\n\nWorks right where you already are—Gmail, Outlook, and your team’s everyday workflows. Fully integrated, fully yours.\n\n---\n\nReady to stop dreading email?\n\nStart your free trial and regain hours every week.\n\nStart free trial\n\n---\n\nFrom problem to product\n\nKevin started Serif with a simple but urgent problem—email was eating his days alive. As a founder and people-facing professional himself, he watched countless hours vanish into writing replies, managing follow-ups, and organizing scattered knowledge. He didn’t need a better email app. He needed an actual assistant. But for most solo professionals and small teams, that kind of help just wasn’t accessible.\n\nSo he set out to build it—creating Serif as a true executive assistant powered by AI. One that could understand your business, draft emails, handle back-and-forths, and free up your schedule. In just 5 months, Serif grew to $400K ARR, powered by an unheard-of 59% email acceptance rate and 83.8% month-one retention. Serif worked—and people started telling others. The viral word of mouth filled early growth without burning a single marketing dollar on paid ads.\n\nNow, Serif powers thousands of inboxes across industries—from the country’s top business broker to fast-growing agencies and B2B sales teams. Customers have sent over 1 million emails with Serif, making only light edits before hitting send. And they’re saving hundreds of hours every week getting out of email and back to running their business. For Kevin, the vision stays the same: make inboxes feel lighter, make decisions faster, and help people finally achieve true email freedom."}]},{"role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"text","text":"Perfect!
