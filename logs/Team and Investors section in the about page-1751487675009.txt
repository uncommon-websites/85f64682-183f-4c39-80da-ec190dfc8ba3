As a founder and people-facing professional himself, he watched countless hours vanish into writing replies, managing follow-ups, and organizing scattered knowledge. He didn't need a better email app. He needed an actual assistant. But for most solo professionals and small teams, that kind of help just wasn't accessible.\",\n38: \t\t\"So he set out to build it—creating Serif as a true executive assistant powered by AI. One that could understand your business, draft emails, handle back-and-forths, and free up your schedule. In just 5 months, Serif grew to $400K ARR, powered by an unheard-of 59% email acceptance rate and 83.8% month-one retention. Serif worked—and people started telling others. The viral word of mouth filled early growth without burning a single marketing dollar on paid ads.\",\n39: \t\t\"Now, Serif powers thousands of inboxes across industries—from the country's top business broker to fast-growing agencies and B2B sales teams. Customers have sent over 1 million emails with Serif, making only light edits before hitting send. And they're saving hundreds of hours every week getting out of email and back to running their business. For Kevin, the vision stays the same: make inboxes feel lighter, make decisions faster, and help people finally achieve true email freedom.\"\n40: \t]}\n41: />\n42: \n43: <!-- Our Culture Section -->\n44: <Culture {values} />\n45: \n46: <!-- StakeholderGrid Section -->\n47: <StakeholderGrid\n48: \tstakeholderType=\"team\"\n49: \ttitle=\"Our team.\"\n50: \tsubtitle=\"Your partners in innovation.\"\n51: \tstakeholders={[\n52: \t\t{\n53: \t\t\tname: \"Alex Morgan\",\n54: \t\t\tposition: \"Founder & CEO\",\n55: \t\t\tbio: \"Started the company with a vision to transform the industry through innovative solutions.\",\n56: \t\t\timage:\n57: \t\t\t\t\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1560250097-0b93528c311a?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=774&q=80\"\n58: \t\t},\n59: \t\t{\n60: \t\t\tname: \"Jamie Chen\",\n61: \t\t\tposition: \"Chief Design Officer\",\n62: \t\t\tbio: \"Award-winning designer with a passion for creating intuitive and beautiful experiences.\",\n63: \t\t\timage:\n64: \t\t\t\t\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1573496359142-b8d87734a5a2?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=776&q=80\"\n65: \t\t},\n66: \t\t{\n67: \t\t\tname: \"Taylor Wright\",\n68: \t\t\tposition: \"Head of Engineering\",\n69: \t\t\tbio: \"Technology enthusiast focused on building scalable systems that make a difference.\",\n70: \t\t\timage:\n71: \t\t\t\t\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1580489944761-15a19d654956?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=774&q=80\"\n72: \t\t}\n73: \t]}\n74: />\n75: \n76: <StakeholderGrid\n77: \tstakeholderType=\"investor\"\n78: \ttitle=\"Backed by the best.\"\n79: \tsubtitle=\"Point Nine, TSIC and others\"\n80: \tstakeholders={[\n81: \t\t{\n82: \t\t\tname: \"Point Nine Capital\",\n83: \t\t\timage: \"https://cdn.brandfetch.io/pointnine.com/w/400/h/400/logo?c=1id_elLz2Bd5Ej-dWo7\"\n84: \t\t},\n85: \t\t{\n86: \t\t\tname: \"TSIC Ventures\",\n87: \t\t\timage: \"https://cdn.brandfetch.io/tiny.vc/w/400/h/400/logo?c=1a2b3c4d5e\"\n88: \t\t},\n89: \t\t{\n90: \t\t\tname: \"Sequoia Capital\",\n91: \t\t\timage: \"https://cdn.brandfetch.io/sequoiacap.com/w/400/h/400/logo\"\n92: \t\t}\n93: \t]}\n94: />\n95: \n96: <!-- CTA Section -->\n97: <CallToAction\n98: \ttitle=\"Ready to collaborate?\"\n99: \tsubtitle=\"Let's create something amazing\"\n100: \tdescription=\"Join the companies already leveraging our expertise to transform their digital presence and achieve their business goals.\"\n101: />\n102: \n\n\n══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\nFILE: ./src/lib/components/layout/StakeholderGrid.svelte\n══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\n1: <script lang=\"ts\">\n2: \timport SectionHeader from \"$lib/components/layout/SectionHeader.svelte\";\n3: \timport Button from \"$lib/components/ui/Button.svelte\";\n4: \timport { animate, stagger } from \"motion\";\n5: \timport { onMount } from \"svelte\";\n6: \n7: \t// Types\n8: \ttype Stakeholder = {\n9: \t\tname: string;\n10: \t\tposition?: string;\n11: \t\tbio?: string;\n12: \t\timage: string;\n13: \t};\n14: \n15: \t// Props\n16: \tconst {\n17: \t\ttitle,\n18: \t\tstakeholderType = \"team\",\n19: \t\tsubtitle,\n20: \t\tstakeholders\n21: \t}: {\n22: \t\tstakeholders: Stakeholder[];\n23: \t\ttitle: string;\n24: \t\tsubtitle: string;\n25: \t\tstakeholderType?: \"team\" | \"investor\";\n26: \t} = $props();\n27: \n28: \tlet cards: HTMLElement[] = $state([]);\n29: \n30: \tonMount(() => {\n31: \t\tif (window.self !== window.top) return;\n32: \t\tanimate(\n33: \t\t\tcards,\n34: \t\t\t{\n35: \t\t\t\ty: [\"1.5rem\", 0],\n36: \t\t\t\tfilter: [\"blur(2px)\", \"blur(0px)\"],\n37: \t\t\t\topacity: [0, 1]\n38: \t\t\t},\n39: \t\t\t{\n40: \t\t\t\tduration: 0.3,\n41: \t\t\t\tease: \"easeOut\",\n42: \t\t\t\tdelay: stagger(0.1, {\n43: \t\t\t\t\tease: \"easeInOut\"\n44: \t\t\t\t})\n45: \t\t\t}\n46: \t\t);\n47: \t});\n48: </script>\n49: \n50: <section class=\"\">\n51: \t<div class=\"section-py section-px container mx-auto grid [--gap:--spacing(4)]\">\n52: \t\t<SectionHeader {title} {subtitle} />\n53: \n54: \t\t<div\n55: \t\t\tclass=\"grid grid-cols-1 gap-(--gap) {stakeholders.length === 1\n56: \t\t\t\t?

As a founder and people-facing professional himself, he watched countless hours vanish into writing replies, managing follow-ups, and organizing scattered knowledge. He didn't need a better email app. He needed an actual assistant. But for most solo professionals and small teams, that kind of help just wasn't accessible.\",\n38: \t\t\"So he set out to build it—creating Serif as a true executive assistant powered by AI. One that could understand your business, draft emails, handle back-and-forths, and free up your schedule. In just 5 months, Serif grew to $400K ARR, powered by an unheard-of 59% email acceptance rate and 83.8% month-one retention. Serif worked—and people started telling others. The viral word of mouth filled early growth without burning a single marketing dollar on paid ads.\",\n39: \t\t\"Now, Serif powers thousands of inboxes across industries—from the country's top business broker to fast-growing agencies and B2B sales teams. Customers have sent over 1 million emails with Serif, making only light edits before hitting send. And they're saving hundreds of hours every week getting out of email and back to running their business. For Kevin, the vision stays the same: make inboxes feel lighter, make decisions faster, and help people finally achieve true email freedom.\"\n40: \t]}\n41: />\n42: \n43: <!-- Our Culture Section -->\n44: <Culture {values} />\n45: \n46: <!-- StakeholderGrid Section -->\n47: <StakeholderGrid\n48: \tstakeholderType=\"team\"\n49: \ttitle=\"Our team.\"\n50: \tsubtitle=\"Your partners in innovation.\"\n51: \tstakeholders={[\n52: \t\t{\n53: \t\t\tname: \"Alex Morgan\",\n54: \t\t\tposition: \"Founder & CEO\",\n55: \t\t\tbio: \"Started the company with a vision to transform the industry through innovative solutions.\",\n56: \t\t\timage:\n57: \t\t\t\t\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1560250097-0b93528c311a?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=774&q=80\"\n58: \t\t},\n59: \t\t{\n60: \t\t\tname: \"Jamie Chen\",\n61: \t\t\tposition: \"Chief Design Officer\",\n62: \t\t\tbio: \"Award-winning designer with a passion for creating intuitive and beautiful experiences.\",\n63: \t\t\timage:\n64: \t\t\t\t\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1573496359142-b8d87734a5a2?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=776&q=80\"\n65: \t\t},\n66: \t\t{\n67: \t\t\tname: \"Taylor Wright\",\n68: \t\t\tposition: \"Head of Engineering\",\n69: \t\t\tbio: \"Technology enthusiast focused on building scalable systems that make a difference.\",\n70: \t\t\timage:\n71: \t\t\t\t\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1580489944761-15a19d654956?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=774&q=80\"\n72: \t\t}\n73: \t]}\n74: />\n75: \n76: <StakeholderGrid\n77: \tstakeholderType=\"investor\"\n78: \ttitle=\"Backed by the best.\"\n79: \tsubtitle=\"Point Nine, TSIC and others\"\n80: \tstakeholders={[\n81: \t\t{\n82: \t\t\tname: \"Point Nine Capital\",\n83: \t\t\timage: \"https://cdn.brandfetch.io/pointnine.com/w/400/h/400/logo?c=1id_elLz2Bd5Ej-dWo7\"\n84: \t\t},\n85: \t\t{\n86: \t\t\tname: \"TSIC Ventures\",\n87: \t\t\timage: \"https://cdn.brandfetch.io/tiny.vc/w/400/h/400/logo?c=1a2b3c4d5e\"\n88: \t\t},\n89: \t\t{\n90: \t\t\tname: \"Sequoia Capital\",\n91: \t\t\timage: \"https://cdn.brandfetch.io/sequoiacap.com/w/400/h/400/logo\"\n92: \t\t}\n93: \t]}\n94: />\n95: \n96: <!-- CTA Section -->\n97: <CallToAction\n98: \ttitle=\"Ready to collaborate?\"\n99: \tsubtitle=\"Let's create something amazing\"\n100: \tdescription=\"Join the companies already leveraging our expertise to transform their digital presence and achieve their business goals.\"\n101: />\n102: \n\n\n══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\nFILE: ./src/lib/components/layout/StakeholderGrid.svelte\n══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\n1: <script lang=\"ts\">\n2: \timport SectionHeader from \"$lib/components/layout/SectionHeader.svelte\";\n3: \timport Button from \"$lib/components/ui/Button.svelte\";\n4: \timport { animate, stagger } from \"motion\";\n5: \timport { onMount } from \"svelte\";\n6: \n7: \t// Types\n8: \ttype Stakeholder = {\n9: \t\tname: string;\n10: \t\tposition?: string;\n11: \t\tbio?: string;\n12: \t\timage: string;\n13: \t};\n14: \n15: \t// Props\n16: \tconst {\n17: \t\ttitle,\n18: \t\tstakeholderType = \"team\",\n19: \t\tsubtitle,\n20: \t\tstakeholders\n21: \t}: {\n22: \t\tstakeholders: Stakeholder[];\n23: \t\ttitle: string;\n24: \t\tsubtitle: string;\n25: \t\tstakeholderType?: \"team\" | \"investor\";\n26: \t} = $props();\n27: \n28: \tlet cards: HTMLElement[] = $state([]);\n29: \n30: \tonMount(() => {\n31: \t\tif (window.self !== window.top) return;\n32: \t\tanimate(\n33: \t\t\tcards,\n34: \t\t\t{\n35: \t\t\t\ty: [\"1.5rem\", 0],\n36: \t\t\t\tfilter: [\"blur(2px)\", \"blur(0px)\"],\n37: \t\t\t\topacity: [0, 1]\n38: \t\t\t},\n39: \t\t\t{\n40: \t\t\t\tduration: 0.3,\n41: \t\t\t\tease: \"easeOut\",\n42: \t\t\t\tdelay: stagger(0.1, {\n43: \t\t\t\t\tease: \"easeInOut\"\n44: \t\t\t\t})\n45: \t\t\t}\n46: \t\t);\n47: \t});\n48: </script>\n49: \n50: <section class=\"\">\n51: \t<div class=\"section-py section-px container mx-auto grid [--gap:--spacing(4)]\">\n52: \t\t<SectionHeader {title} {subtitle} />\n53: \n54: \t\t<div\n55: \t\t\tclass=\"grid grid-cols-1 gap-(--gap) {stakeholders.length === 1\n56: \t\t\t\t?

As a founder and people-facing professional himself, he watched countless hours vanish into writing replies, managing follow-ups, and organizing scattered knowledge. He didn't need a better email app. He needed an actual assistant. But for most solo professionals and small teams, that kind of help just wasn't accessible.\",\n38: \t\t\"So he set out to build it—creating Serif as a true executive assistant powered by AI. One that could understand your business, draft emails, handle back-and-forths, and free up your schedule. In just 5 months, Serif grew to $400K ARR, powered by an unheard-of 59% email acceptance rate and 83.8% month-one retention. Serif worked—and people started telling others. The viral word of mouth filled early growth without burning a single marketing dollar on paid ads.\",\n39: \t\t\"Now, Serif powers thousands of inboxes across industries—from the country's top business broker to fast-growing agencies and B2B sales teams. Customers have sent over 1 million emails with Serif, making only light edits before hitting send. And they're saving hundreds of hours every week getting out of email and back to running their business. For Kevin, the vision stays the same: make inboxes feel lighter, make decisions faster, and help people finally achieve true email freedom.\"\n40: \t]}\n41: />\n42: \n43: <!-- Our Culture Section -->\n44: <Culture {values} />\n45: \n46: <!-- StakeholderGrid Section -->\n47: <StakeholderGrid\n48: \tstakeholderType=\"team\"\n49: \ttitle=\"Our team.\"\n50: \tsubtitle=\"Your partners in innovation.\"\n51: \tstakeholders={[\n52: \t\t{\n53: \t\t\tname: \"Alex Morgan\",\n54: \t\t\tposition: \"Founder & CEO\",\n55: \t\t\tbio: \"Started the company with a vision to transform the industry through innovative solutions.\",\n56: \t\t\timage:\n57: \t\t\t\t\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1560250097-0b93528c311a?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=774&q=80\"\n58: \t\t},\n59: \t\t{\n60: \t\t\tname: \"Jamie Chen\",\n61: \t\t\tposition: \"Chief Design Officer\",\n62: \t\t\tbio: \"Award-winning designer with a passion for creating intuitive and beautiful experiences.\",\n63: \t\t\timage:\n64: \t\t\t\t\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1573496359142-b8d87734a5a2?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=776&q=80\"\n65: \t\t},\n66: \t\t{\n67: \t\t\tname: \"Taylor Wright\",\n68: \t\t\tposition: \"Head of Engineering\",\n69: \t\t\tbio: \"Technology enthusiast focused on building scalable systems that make a difference.\",\n70: \t\t\timage:\n71: \t\t\t\t\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1580489944761-15a19d654956?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=774&q=80\"\n72: \t\t}\n73: \t]}\n74: />\n75: \n76: <StakeholderGrid\n77: \tstakeholderType=\"investor\"\n78: \ttitle=\"Backed by the best.\"\n79: \tsubtitle=\"Point Nine, TSIC and others\"\n80: \tstakeholders={[\n81: \t\t{\n82: \t\t\tname: \"Point Nine Capital\",\n83: \t\t\timage: \"https://cdn.brandfetch.io/pointnine.com/w/400/h/400/logo?c=1id_elLz2Bd5Ej-dWo7\"\n84: \t\t},\n85: \t\t{\n86: \t\t\tname: \"TSIC Ventures\",\n87: \t\t\timage: \"https://cdn.brandfetch.io/tiny.vc/w/400/h/400/logo?c=1a2b3c4d5e\"\n88: \t\t},\n89: \t\t{\n90: \t\t\tname: \"Sequoia Capital\",\n91: \t\t\timage: \"https://cdn.brandfetch.io/sequoiacap.com/w/400/h/400/logo\"\n92: \t\t}\n93: \t]}\n94: />\n95: \n96: <!-- CTA Section -->\n97: <CallToAction\n98: \ttitle=\"Ready to collaborate?\"\n99: \tsubtitle=\"Let's create something amazing\"\n100: \tdescription=\"Join the companies already leveraging our expertise to transform their digital presence and achieve their business goals.\"\n101: />\n102: \n\n\n══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\nFILE: ./src/lib/components/layout/StakeholderGrid.svelte\n══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\n1: <script lang=\"ts\">\n2: \timport SectionHeader from \"$lib/components/layout/SectionHeader.svelte\";\n3: \timport Button from \"$lib/components/ui/Button.svelte\";\n4: \timport { animate, stagger } from \"motion\";\n5: \timport { onMount } from \"svelte\";\n6: \n7: \t// Types\n8: \ttype Stakeholder = {\n9: \t\tname: string;\n10: \t\tposition?: string;\n11: \t\tbio?: string;\n12: \t\timage: string;\n13: \t};\n14: \n15: \t// Props\n16: \tconst {\n17: \t\ttitle,\n18: \t\tstakeholderType = \"team\",\n19: \t\tsubtitle,\n20: \t\tstakeholders\n21: \t}: {\n22: \t\tstakeholders: Stakeholder[];\n23: \t\ttitle: string;\n24: \t\tsubtitle: string;\n25: \t\tstakeholderType?: \"team\" | \"investor\";\n26: \t} = $props();\n27: \n28: \tlet cards: HTMLElement[] = $state([]);\n29: \n30: \tonMount(() => {\n31: \t\tif (window.self !== window.top) return;\n32: \t\tanimate(\n33: \t\t\tcards,\n34: \t\t\t{\n35: \t\t\t\ty: [\"1.5rem\", 0],\n36: \t\t\t\tfilter: [\"blur(2px)\", \"blur(0px)\"],\n37: \t\t\t\topacity: [0, 1]\n38: \t\t\t},\n39: \t\t\t{\n40: \t\t\t\tduration: 0.3,\n41: \t\t\t\tease: \"easeOut\",\n42: \t\t\t\tdelay: stagger(0.1, {\n43: \t\t\t\t\tease: \"easeInOut\"\n44: \t\t\t\t})\n45: \t\t\t}\n46: \t\t);\n47: \t});\n48: </script>\n49: \n50: <section class=\"\">\n51: \t<div class=\"section-py section-px container mx-auto grid [--gap:--spacing(4)]\">\n52: \t\t<SectionHeader {title} {subtitle} />\n53: \n54: \t\t<div\n55: \t\t\tclass=\"grid grid-cols-1 gap-(--gap) {stakeholders.length === 1\n56: \t\t\t\t?

In just 5 months, Serif grew to $400K ARR, powered by an unheard-of 59% email acceptance rate and 83.8% month-one retention. Serif worked—and people started telling others. The viral word of mouth filled early growth without burning a single marketing dollar on paid ads.\",\n39: \t\t\"Now, Serif powers thousands of inboxes across industries—from the country's top business broker to fast-growing agencies and B2B sales teams. Customers have sent over 1 million emails with Serif, making only light edits before hitting send. And they're saving hundreds of hours every week getting out of email and back to running their business. For Kevin, the vision stays the same: make inboxes feel lighter, make decisions faster, and help people finally achieve true email freedom.\"\n40: \t]}\n41: />\n42: \n43: <!-- Our Culture Section -->\n44: <Culture {values} />\n45: \n46: <!-- StakeholderGrid Section -->\n47: <StakeholderGrid\n48: \tstakeholderType=\"team\"\n49: \ttitle=\"Our team.\"\n50: \tsubtitle=\"Your partners in innovation.\"\n51: \tstakeholders={[\n52: \t\t{\n53: \t\t\tname: \"Alex Morgan\",\n54: \t\t\tposition: \"Founder & CEO\",\n55: \t\t\tbio: \"Started the company with a vision to transform the industry through innovative solutions.\",\n56: \t\t\timage:\n57: \t\t\t\t\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1560250097-0b93528c311a?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=774&q=80\"\n58: \t\t},\n59: \t\t{\n60: \t\t\tname: \"Jamie Chen\",\n61: \t\t\tposition: \"Chief Design Officer\",\n62: \t\t\tbio: \"Award-winning designer with a passion for creating intuitive and beautiful experiences.\",\n63: \t\t\timage:\n64: \t\t\t\t\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1573496359142-b8d87734a5a2?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=776&q=80\"\n65: \t\t},\n66: \t\t{\n67: \t\t\tname: \"Taylor Wright\",\n68: \t\t\tposition: \"Head of Engineering\",\n69: \t\t\tbio: \"Technology enthusiast focused on building scalable systems that make a difference.\",\n70: \t\t\timage:\n71: \t\t\t\t\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1580489944761-15a19d654956?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=774&q=80\"\n72: \t\t}\n73: \t]}\n74: />\n75: \n76: <StakeholderGrid\n77: \tstakeholderType=\"investor\"\n78: \ttitle=\"Backed by the best.\"\n79: \tsubtitle=\"Point Nine, TSIC and others\"\n80: \tstakeholders={[\n81: \t\t{\n82: \t\t\tname: \"Point Nine Capital\",\n83: \t\t\timage: \"https://cdn.brandfetch.io/pointnine.com/w/400/h/400/logo?c=1id_elLz2Bd5Ej-dWo7\"\n84: \t\t},\n85: \t\t{\n86: \t\t\tname: \"TSIC Ventures\",\n87: \t\t\timage: \"https://cdn.brandfetch.io/tiny.vc/w/400/h/400/logo?c=1a2b3c4d5e\"\n88: \t\t},\n89: \t\t{\n90: \t\t\tname: \"Sequoia Capital\",\n91: \t\t\timage: \"https://cdn.brandfetch.io/sequoiacap.com/w/400/h/400/logo\"\n92: \t\t}\n93: \t]}\n94: />\n95: \n96: <!-- CTA Section -->\n97: <CallToAction\n98: \ttitle=\"Ready to collaborate?\"\n99: \tsubtitle=\"Let's create something amazing\"\n100: \tdescription=\"Join the companies already leveraging our expertise to transform their digital presence and achieve their business goals.\"\n101: />\n102: \n\n\n══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\nFILE: ./src/lib/components/layout/StakeholderGrid.svelte\n══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\n1: <script lang=\"ts\">\n2: \timport SectionHeader from \"$lib/components/layout/SectionHeader.svelte\";\n3: \timport Button from \"$lib/components/ui/Button.svelte\";\n4: \timport { animate, stagger } from \"motion\";\n5: \timport { onMount } from \"svelte\";\n6: \n7: \t// Types\n8: \ttype Stakeholder = {\n9: \t\tname: string;\n10: \t\tposition?: string;\n11: \t\tbio?: string;\n12: \t\timage: string;\n13: \t};\n14: \n15: \t// Props\n16: \tconst {\n17: \t\ttitle,\n18: \t\tstakeholderType = \"team\",\n19: \t\tsubtitle,\n20: \t\tstakeholders\n21: \t}: {\n22: \t\tstakeholders: Stakeholder[];\n23: \t\ttitle: string;\n24: \t\tsubtitle: string;\n25: \t\tstakeholderType?: \"team\" | \"investor\";\n26: \t} = $props();\n27: \n28: \tlet cards: HTMLElement[] = $state([]);\n29: \n30: \tonMount(() => {\n31: \t\tif (window.self !== window.top) return;\n32: \t\tanimate(\n33: \t\t\tcards,\n34: \t\t\t{\n35: \t\t\t\ty: [\"1.5rem\", 0],\n36: \t\t\t\tfilter: [\"blur(2px)\", \"blur(0px)\"],\n37: \t\t\t\topacity: [0, 1]\n38: \t\t\t},\n39: \t\t\t{\n40: \t\t\t\tduration: 0.3,\n41: \t\t\t\tease: \"easeOut\",\n42: \t\t\t\tdelay: stagger(0.1, {\n43: \t\t\t\t\tease: \"easeInOut\"\n44: \t\t\t\t})\n45: \t\t\t}\n46: \t\t);\n47: \t});\n48: </script>\n49: \n50: <section class=\"\">\n51: \t<div class=\"section-py section-px container mx-auto grid [--gap:--spacing(4)]\">\n52: \t\t<SectionHeader {title} {subtitle} />\n53: \n54: \t\t<div\n55: \t\t\tclass=\"grid grid-cols-1 gap-(--gap) {stakeholders.length === 1\n56: \t\t\t\t?

For Kevin, the vision stays the same: make inboxes feel lighter, make decisions faster, and help people finally achieve true email freedom.\"\n40: \t]}\n41: />\n42: \n43: <!-- Our Culture Section -->\n44: <Culture {values} />\n45: \n46: <!-- StakeholderGrid Section -->\n47: <StakeholderGrid\n48: \tstakeholderType=\"team\"\n49: \ttitle=\"Our team.\"\n50: \tsubtitle=\"Your partners in innovation.\"\n51: \tstakeholders={[\n52: \t\t{\n53: \t\t\tname: \"Alex Morgan\",\n54: \t\t\tposition: \"Founder & CEO\",\n55: \t\t\tbio: \"Started the company with a vision to transform the industry through innovative solutions.\",\n56: \t\t\timage:\n57: \t\t\t\t\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1560250097-0b93528c311a?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=774&q=80\"\n58: \t\t},\n59: \t\t{\n60: \t\t\tname: \"Jamie Chen\",\n61: \t\t\tposition: \"Chief Design Officer\",\n62: \t\t\tbio: \"Award-winning designer with a passion for creating intuitive and beautiful experiences.\",\n63: \t\t\timage:\n64: \t\t\t\t\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1573496359142-b8d87734a5a2?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=776&q=80\"\n65: \t\t},\n66: \t\t{\n67: \t\t\tname: \"Taylor Wright\",\n68: \t\t\tposition: \"Head of Engineering\",\n69: \t\t\tbio: \"Technology enthusiast focused on building scalable systems that make a difference.\",\n70: \t\t\timage:\n71: \t\t\t\t\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1580489944761-15a19d654956?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=774&q=80\"\n72: \t\t}\n73: \t]}\n74: />\n75: \n76: <StakeholderGrid\n77: \tstakeholderType=\"investor\"\n78: \ttitle=\"Backed by the best.\"\n79: \tsubtitle=\"Point Nine, TSIC and others\"\n80: \tstakeholders={[\n81: \t\t{\n82: \t\t\tname: \"Point Nine Capital\",\n83: \t\t\timage: \"https://cdn.brandfetch.io/pointnine.com/w/400/h/400/logo?c=1id_elLz2Bd5Ej-dWo7\"\n84: \t\t},\n85: \t\t{\n86: \t\t\tname: \"TSIC Ventures\",\n87: \t\t\timage: \"https://cdn.brandfetch.io/tiny.vc/w/400/h/400/logo?c=1a2b3c4d5e\"\n88: \t\t},\n89: \t\t{\n90: \t\t\tname: \"Sequoia Capital\",\n91: \t\t\timage: \"https://cdn.brandfetch.io/sequoiacap.com/w/400/h/400/logo\"\n92: \t\t}\n93: \t]}\n94: />\n95: \n96: <!-- CTA Section -->\n97: <CallToAction\n98: \ttitle=\"Ready to collaborate?\"\n99: \tsubtitle=\"Let's create something amazing\"\n100: \tdescription=\"Join the companies already leveraging our expertise to transform their digital presence and achieve their business goals.\"\n101: />\n102: \n\n\n══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\nFILE: ./src/lib/components/layout/StakeholderGrid.svelte\n══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\n1: <script lang=\"ts\">\n2: \timport SectionHeader from \"$lib/components/layout/SectionHeader.svelte\";\n3: \timport Button from \"$lib/components/ui/Button.svelte\";\n4: \timport { animate, stagger } from \"motion\";\n5: \timport { onMount } from \"svelte\";\n6: \n7: \t// Types\n8: \ttype Stakeholder = {\n9: \t\tname: string;\n10: \t\tposition?: string;\n11: \t\tbio?: string;\n12: \t\timage: string;\n13: \t};\n14: \n15: \t// Props\n16: \tconst {\n17: \t\ttitle,\n18: \t\tstakeholderType = \"team\",\n19: \t\tsubtitle,\n20: \t\tstakeholders\n21: \t}: {\n22: \t\tstakeholders: Stakeholder[];\n23: \t\ttitle: string;\n24: \t\tsubtitle: string;\n25: \t\tstakeholderType?: \"team\" | \"investor\";\n26: \t} = $props();\n27: \n28: \tlet cards: HTMLElement[] = $state([]);\n29: \n30: \tonMount(() => {\n31: \t\tif (window.self !== window.top) return;\n32: \t\tanimate(\n33: \t\t\tcards,\n34: \t\t\t{\n35: \t\t\t\ty: [\"1.5rem\", 0],\n36: \t\t\t\tfilter: [\"blur(2px)\", \"blur(0px)\"],\n37: \t\t\t\topacity: [0, 1]\n38: \t\t\t},\n39: \t\t\t{\n40: \t\t\t\tduration: 0.3,\n41: \t\t\t\tease: \"easeOut\",\n42: \t\t\t\tdelay: stagger(0.1, {\n43: \t\t\t\t\tease: \"easeInOut\"\n44: \t\t\t\t})\n45: \t\t\t}\n46: \t\t);\n47: \t});\n48: </script>\n49: \n50: <section class=\"\">\n51: \t<div class=\"section-py section-px container mx-auto grid [--gap:--spacing(4)]\">\n52: \t\t<SectionHeader {title} {subtitle} />\n53: \n54: \t\t<div\n55: \t\t\tclass=\"grid grid-cols-1 gap-(--gap) {stakeholders.length === 1\n56: \t\t\t\t?

As a founder and people-facing professional himself, he watched countless hours vanish into writing replies, managing follow-ups, and organizing scattered knowledge. He didn't need a better email app. He needed an actual assistant. But for most solo professionals and small teams, that kind of help just wasn't accessible.\",\n38: \t\t\"So he set out to build it—creating Serif as a true executive assistant powered by AI. One that could understand your business, draft emails, handle back-and-forths, and free up your schedule. In just 5 months, Serif grew to $400K ARR, powered by an unheard-of 59% email acceptance rate and 83.8% month-one retention. Serif worked—and people started telling others. The viral word of mouth filled early growth without burning a single marketing dollar on paid ads.\",\n39: \t\t\"Now, Serif powers thousands of inboxes across industries—from the country's top business broker to fast-growing agencies and B2B sales teams. Customers have sent over 1 million emails with Serif, making only light edits before hitting send. And they're saving hundreds of hours every week getting out of email and back to running their business. For Kevin, the vision stays the same: make inboxes feel lighter, make decisions faster, and help people finally achieve true email freedom.\"\n40: \t]}\n41: />\n42: \n43: <!-- Our Culture Section -->\n44: <Culture {values} />\n45: \n46: <!-- StakeholderGrid Section -->\n47: <StakeholderGrid\n48: \tstakeholderType=\"team\"\n49: \ttitle=\"Our team.\"\n50: \tsubtitle=\"Your partners in innovation.\"\n51: \tstakeholders={[\n52: \t\t{\n53: \t\t\tname: \"Alex Morgan\",\n54: \t\t\tposition: \"Founder & CEO\",\n55: \t\t\tbio: \"Started the company with a vision to transform the industry through innovative solutions.\",\n56: \t\t\timage:\n57: \t\t\t\t\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1560250097-0b93528c311a?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=774&q=80\"\n58: \t\t},\n59: \t\t{\n60: \t\t\tname: \"Jamie Chen\",\n61: \t\t\tposition: \"Chief Design Officer\",\n62: \t\t\tbio: \"Award-winning designer with a passion for creating intuitive and beautiful experiences.\",\n63: \t\t\timage:\n64: \t\t\t\t\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1573496359142-b8d87734a5a2?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=776&q=80\"\n65: \t\t},\n66: \t\t{\n67: \t\t\tname: \"Taylor Wright\",\n68: \t\t\tposition: \"Head of Engineering\",\n69: \t\t\tbio: \"Technology enthusiast focused on building scalable systems that make a difference.\",\n70: \t\t\timage:\n71: \t\t\t\t\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1580489944761-15a19d654956?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=774&q=80\"\n72: \t\t}\n73: \t]}\n74: />\n75: \n76: <StakeholderGrid\n77: \tstakeholderType=\"investor\"\n78: \ttitle=\"Backed by the best.\"\n79: \tsubtitle=\"Point Nine, TSIC and others\"\n80: \tstakeholders={[\n81: \t\t{\n82: \t\t\tname: \"Point Nine Capital\",\n83: \t\t\timage: \"https://cdn.brandfetch.io/pointnine.com/w/400/h/400/logo?c=1id_elLz2Bd5Ej-dWo7\"\n84: \t\t},\n85: \t\t{\n86: \t\t\tname: \"TSIC Ventures\",\n87: \t\t\timage: \"https://cdn.brandfetch.io/tiny.vc/w/400/h/400/logo?c=1a2b3c4d5e\"\n88: \t\t},\n89: \t\t{\n90: \t\t\tname: \"Sequoia Capital\",\n91: \t\t\timage: \"https://cdn.brandfetch.io/sequoiacap.com/w/400/h/400/logo\"\n92: \t\t}\n93: \t]}\n94: />\n95: \n96: <!-- CTA Section -->\n97: <CallToAction\n98: \ttitle=\"Ready to collaborate?\"\n99: \tsubtitle=\"Let's create something amazing\"\n100: \tdescription=\"Join the companies already leveraging our expertise to transform their digital presence and achieve their business goals.\"\n101: />\n102: \n\n\n══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\nFILE: ./src/lib/components/layout/StakeholderGrid.svelte\n══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\n1: <script lang=\"ts\">\n2: \timport SectionHeader from \"$lib/components/layout/SectionHeader.svelte\";\n3: \timport Button from \"$lib/components/ui/Button.svelte\";\n4: \timport { animate, stagger } from \"motion\";\n5: \timport { onMount } from \"svelte\";\n6: \n7: \t// Types\n8: \ttype Stakeholder = {\n9: \t\tname: string;\n10: \t\tposition?: string;\n11: \t\tbio?: string;\n12: \t\timage: string;\n13: \t};\n14: \n15: \t// Props\n16: \tconst {\n17: \t\ttitle,\n18: \t\tstakeholderType = \"team\",\n19: \t\tsubtitle,\n20: \t\tstakeholders\n21: \t}: {\n22: \t\tstakeholders: Stakeholder[];\n23: \t\ttitle: string;\n24: \t\tsubtitle: string;\n25: \t\tstakeholderType?: \"team\" | \"investor\";\n26: \t} = $props();\n27: \n28: \tlet cards: HTMLElement[] = $state([]);\n29: \n30: \tonMount(() => {\n31: \t\tif (window.self !== window.top) return;\n32: \t\tanimate(\n33: \t\t\tcards,\n34: \t\t\t{\n35: \t\t\t\ty: [\"1.5rem\", 0],\n36: \t\t\t\tfilter: [\"blur(2px)\", \"blur(0px)\"],\n37: \t\t\t\topacity: [0, 1]\n38: \t\t\t},\n39: \t\t\t{\n40: \t\t\t\tduration: 0.3,\n41: \t\t\t\tease: \"easeOut\",\n42: \t\t\t\tdelay: stagger(0.1, {\n43: \t\t\t\t\tease: \"easeInOut\"\n44: \t\t\t\t})\n45: \t\t\t}\n46: \t\t);\n47: \t});\n48: </script>\n49: \n50: <section class=\"\">\n51: \t<div class=\"section-py section-px container mx-auto grid [--gap:--spacing(4)]\">\n52: \t\t<SectionHeader {title} {subtitle} />\n53: \n54: \t\t<div\n55: \t\t\tclass=\"grid grid-cols-1 gap-(--gap) {stakeholders.length === 1\n56: \t\t\t\t?

As a founder and people-facing professional himself, he watched countless hours vanish into writing replies, managing follow-ups, and organizing scattered knowledge. He didn't need a better email app. He needed an actual assistant. But for most solo professionals and small teams, that kind of help just wasn't accessible.\",\n38: \t\t\"So he set out to build it—creating Serif as a true executive assistant powered by AI. One that could understand your business, draft emails, handle back-and-forths, and free up your schedule. In just 5 months, Serif grew to $400K ARR, powered by an unheard-of 59% email acceptance rate and 83.8% month-one retention. Serif worked—and people started telling others. The viral word of mouth filled early growth without burning a single marketing dollar on paid ads.\",\n39: \t\t\"Now, Serif powers thousands of inboxes across industries—from the country's top business broker to fast-growing agencies and B2B sales teams. Customers have sent over 1 million emails with Serif, making only light edits before hitting send. And they're saving hundreds of hours every week getting out of email and back to running their business. For Kevin, the vision stays the same: make inboxes feel lighter, make decisions faster, and help people finally achieve true email freedom.\"\n40: \t]}\n41: />\n42: \n43: <!-- Our Culture Section -->\n44: <Culture {values} />\n45: \n46: <!-- StakeholderGrid Section -->\n47: <StakeholderGrid\n48: \tstakeholderType=\"team\"\n49: \ttitle=\"Our team.\"\n50: \tsubtitle=\"Your partners in innovation.\"\n51: \tstakeholders={[\n52: \t\t{\n53: \t\t\tname: \"Alex Morgan\",\n54: \t\t\tposition: \"Founder & CEO\",\n55: \t\t\tbio: \"Started the company with a vision to transform the industry through innovative solutions.\",\n56: \t\t\timage:\n57: \t\t\t\t\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1560250097-0b93528c311a?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=774&q=80\"\n58: \t\t},\n59: \t\t{\n60: \t\t\tname: \"Jamie Chen\",\n61: \t\t\tposition: \"Chief Design Officer\",\n62: \t\t\tbio: \"Award-winning designer with a passion for creating intuitive and beautiful experiences.\",\n63: \t\t\timage:\n64: \t\t\t\t\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1573496359142-b8d87734a5a2?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=776&q=80\"\n65: \t\t},\n66: \t\t{\n67: \t\t\tname: \"Taylor Wright\",\n68: \t\t\tposition: \"Head of Engineering\",\n69: \t\t\tbio: \"Technology enthusiast focused on building scalable systems that make a difference.\",\n70: \t\t\timage:\n71: \t\t\t\t\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1580489944761-15a19d654956?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=774&q=80\"\n72: \t\t}\n73: \t]}\n74: />\n75: \n76: <StakeholderGrid\n77: \tstakeholderType=\"investor\"\n78: \ttitle=\"Backed by the best.\"\n79: \tsubtitle=\"Point Nine, TSIC and others\"\n80: \tstakeholders={[\n81: \t\t{\n82: \t\t\tname: \"Point Nine Capital\",\n83: \t\t\timage: \"https://cdn.brandfetch.io/pointnine.com/w/400/h/400/logo?c=1id_elLz2Bd5Ej-dWo7\"\n84: \t\t},\n85: \t\t{\n86: \t\t\tname: \"TSIC Ventures\",\n87: \t\t\timage: \"https://cdn.brandfetch.io/tiny.vc/w/400/h/400/logo?c=1a2b3c4d5e\"\n88: \t\t},\n89: \t\t{\n90: \t\t\tname: \"Sequoia Capital\",\n91: \t\t\timage: \"https://cdn.brandfetch.io/sequoiacap.com/w/400/h/400/logo\"\n92: \t\t}\n93: \t]}\n94: />\n95: \n96: <!-- CTA Section -->\n97: <CallToAction\n98: \ttitle=\"Ready to collaborate?\"\n99: \tsubtitle=\"Let's create something amazing\"\n100: \tdescription=\"Join the companies already leveraging our expertise to transform their digital presence and achieve their business goals.\"\n101: />\n102: \n\n\n══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\nFILE: ./src/lib/components/layout/StakeholderGrid.svelte\n══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\n1: <script lang=\"ts\">\n2: \timport SectionHeader from \"$lib/components/layout/SectionHeader.svelte\";\n3: \timport Button from \"$lib/components/ui/Button.svelte\";\n4: \timport { animate, stagger } from \"motion\";\n5: \timport { onMount } from \"svelte\";\n6: \n7: \t// Types\n8: \ttype Stakeholder = {\n9: \t\tname: string;\n10: \t\tposition?: string;\n11: \t\tbio?: string;\n12: \t\timage: string;\n13: \t};\n14: \n15: \t// Props\n16: \tconst {\n17: \t\ttitle,\n18: \t\tstakeholderType = \"team\",\n19: \t\tsubtitle,\n20: \t\tstakeholders\n21: \t}: {\n22: \t\tstakeholders: Stakeholder[];\n23: \t\ttitle: string;\n24: \t\tsubtitle: string;\n25: \t\tstakeholderType?: \"team\" | \"investor\";\n26: \t} = $props();\n27: \n28: \tlet cards: HTMLElement[] = $state([]);\n29: \n30: \tonMount(() => {\n31: \t\tif (window.self !== window.top) return;\n32: \t\tanimate(\n33: \t\t\tcards,\n34: \t\t\t{\n35: \t\t\t\ty: [\"1.5rem\", 0],\n36: \t\t\t\tfilter: [\"blur(2px)\", \"blur(0px)\"],\n37: \t\t\t\topacity: [0, 1]\n38: \t\t\t},\n39: \t\t\t{\n40: \t\t\t\tduration: 0.3,\n41: \t\t\t\tease: \"easeOut\",\n42: \t\t\t\tdelay: stagger(0.1, {\n43: \t\t\t\t\tease: \"easeInOut\"\n44: \t\t\t\t})\n45: \t\t\t}\n46: \t\t);\n47: \t});\n48: </script>\n49: \n50: <section class=\"\">\n51: \t<div class=\"section-py section-px container mx-auto grid [--gap:--spacing(4)]\">\n52: \t\t<SectionHeader {title} {subtitle} />\n53: \n54: \t\t<div\n55: \t\t\tclass=\"grid grid-cols-1 gap-(--gap) {stakeholders.length === 1\n56: \t\t\t\t?

As a founder and people-facing professional himself, he watched countless hours vanish into writing replies, managing follow-ups, and organizing scattered knowledge. He didn't need a better email app. He needed an actual assistant. But for most solo professionals and small teams, that kind of help just wasn't accessible.\",\n38: \t\t\"So he set out to build it—creating Serif as a true executive assistant powered by AI. One that could understand your business, draft emails, handle back-and-forths, and free up your schedule. In just 5 months, Serif grew to $400K ARR, powered by an unheard-of 59% email acceptance rate and 83.8% month-one retention. Serif worked—and people started telling others. The viral word of mouth filled early growth without burning a single marketing dollar on paid ads.\",\n39: \t\t\"Now, Serif powers thousands of inboxes across industries—from the country's top business broker to fast-growing agencies and B2B sales teams. Customers have sent over 1 million emails with Serif, making only light edits before hitting send. And they're saving hundreds of hours every week getting out of email and back to running their business.

As a founder and people-facing professional himself, he watched countless hours vanish into writing replies, managing follow-ups, and organizing scattered knowledge. He didn't need a better email app. He needed an actual assistant. But for most solo professionals and small teams, that kind of help just wasn't accessible.\",\n38: \t\t\"So he set out to build it—creating Serif as a true executive assistant powered by AI. One that could understand your business, draft emails, handle back-and-forths, and free up your schedule. In just 5 months, Serif grew to $400K ARR, powered by an unheard-of 59% email acceptance rate and 83.8% month-one retention. Serif worked—and people started telling others. The viral word of mouth filled early growth without burning a single marketing dollar on paid ads.\",\n39: \t\t\"Now, Serif powers thousands of inboxes across industries—from the country's top business broker to fast-growing agencies and B2B sales teams. Customers have sent over 1 million emails with Serif, making only light edits before hitting send. And they're saving hundreds of hours every week getting out of email and back to running their business. For Kevin, the vision stays the same: make inboxes feel lighter, make decisions faster, and help people finally achieve true email freedom.\"\n40: \t]}\n41: />\n42: \n43: <!-- Our Culture Section -->\n44: <Culture {values} />\n45: \n46: <!-- StakeholderGrid Section -->\n47: <StakeholderGrid\n48: \tstakeholderType=\"team\"\n49: \ttitle=\"Our team.\"\n50: \tsubtitle=\"Your partners in innovation.\"\n51: \tstakeholders={[\n52: \t\t{\n53: \t\t\tname: \"Alex Morgan\",\n54: \t\t\tposition: \"Founder & CEO\",\n55: \t\t\tbio: \"Started the company with a vision to transform the industry through innovative solutions.\",\n56: \t\t\timage:\n57: \t\t\t\t\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1560250097-0b93528c311a?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=774&q=80\"\n58: \t\t},\n59: \t\t{\n60: \t\t\tname: \"Jamie Chen\",\n61: \t\t\tposition: \"Chief Design Officer\",\n62: \t\t\tbio: \"Award-winning designer with a passion for creating intuitive and beautiful experiences.\",\n63: \t\t\timage:\n64: \t\t\t\t\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1573496359142-b8d87734a5a2?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=776&q=80\"\n65: \t\t},\n66: \t\t{\n67: \t\t\tname: \"Taylor Wright\",\n68: \t\t\tposition: \"Head of Engineering\",\n69: \t\t\tbio: \"Technology enthusiast focused on building scalable systems that make a difference.\",\n70: \t\t\timage:\n71: \t\t\t\t\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1580489944761-15a19d654956?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=774&q=80\"\n72: \t\t}\n73: \t]}\n74: />\n75: \n76: <StakeholderGrid\n77: \tstakeholderType=\"investor\"\n78: \ttitle=\"Backed by the best.\"\n79: \tsubtitle=\"Point Nine, TSIC and others\"\n80: \tstakeholders={[\n81: \t\t{\n82: \t\t\tname: \"Point Nine Capital\",\n83: \t\t\timage: \"https://cdn.brandfetch.io/pointnine.com/w/400/h/400/logo?c=1id_elLz2Bd5Ej-dWo7\"\n84: \t\t},\n85: \t\t{\n86: \t\t\tname: \"TSIC Ventures\",\n87: \t\t\timage: \"https://cdn.brandfetch.io/tiny.vc/w/400/h/400/logo?c=1a2b3c4d5e\"\n88: \t\t},\n89: \t\t{\n90: \t\t\tname: \"Sequoia Capital\",\n91: \t\t\timage: \"https://cdn.brandfetch.io/sequoiacap.com/w/400/h/400/logo\"\n92: \t\t}\n93: \t]}\n94: />\n95: \n96: <!-- CTA Section -->\n97: <CallToAction\n98: \ttitle=\"Ready to collaborate?\"\n99: \tsubtitle=\"Let's create something amazing\"\n100: \tdescription=\"Join the companies already leveraging our expertise to transform their digital presence and achieve their business goals.\"\n101: />\n102: \n\n\n══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\nFILE: ./src/lib/components/layout/StakeholderGrid.svelte\n══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\n1: <script lang=\"ts\">\n2: \timport SectionHeader from \"$lib/components/layout/SectionHeader.svelte\";\n3: \timport Button from \"$lib/components/ui/Button.svelte\";\n4: \timport { animate, stagger } from \"motion\";\n5: \timport { onMount } from \"svelte\";\n6: \n7: \t// Types\n8: \ttype Stakeholder = {\n9: \t\tname: string;\n10: \t\tposition?: string;\n11: \t\tbio?: string;\n12: \t\timage: string;\n13: \t};\n14: \n15: \t// Props\n16: \tconst {\n17: \t\ttitle,\n18: \t\tstakeholderType = \"team\",\n19: \t\tsubtitle,\n20: \t\tstakeholders\n21: \t}: {\n22: \t\tstakeholders: Stakeholder[];\n23: \t\ttitle: string;\n24: \t\tsubtitle: string;\n25: \t\tstakeholderType?: \"team\" | \"investor\";\n26: \t} = $props();\n27: \n28: \tlet cards: HTMLElement[] = $state([]);\n29: \n30: \tonMount(() => {\n31: \t\tif (window.self !== window.top) return;\n32: \t\tanimate(\n33: \t\t\tcards,\n34: \t\t\t{\n35: \t\t\t\ty: [\"1.5rem\", 0],\n36: \t\t\t\tfilter: [\"blur(2px)\", \"blur(0px)\"],\n37: \t\t\t\topacity: [0, 1]\n38: \t\t\t},\n39: \t\t\t{\n40: \t\t\t\tduration: 0.3,\n41: \t\t\t\tease: \"easeOut\",\n42: \t\t\t\tdelay: stagger(0.1, {\n43: \t\t\t\t\tease: \"easeInOut\"\n44: \t\t\t\t})\n45: \t\t\t}\n46: \t\t);\n47: \t});\n48: </script>\n49: \n50: <section class=\"\">\n51: \t<div class=\"section-py section-px container mx-auto grid [--gap:--spacing(4)]\">\n52: \t\t<SectionHeader {title} {subtitle} />\n53: \n54: \t\t<div\n55: \t\t\tclass=\"grid grid-cols-1 gap-(--gap) {stakeholders.length === 1\n56: \t\t\t\t?

As a founder and people-facing professional himself, he watched countless hours vanish into writing replies, managing follow-ups, and organizing scattered knowledge. He didn't need a better email app. He needed an actual assistant. But for most solo professionals and small teams, that kind of help just wasn't accessible.\",\n38: \t\t\"So he set out to build it—creating Serif as a true executive assistant powered by AI. One that could understand your business, draft emails, handle back-and-forths, and free up your schedule. In just 5 months, Serif grew to $400K ARR, powered by an unheard-of 59% email acceptance rate and 83.8% month-one retention. Serif worked—and people started telling others. The viral word of mouth filled early growth without burning a single marketing dollar on paid ads.\",\n39: \t\t\"Now, Serif powers thousands of inboxes across industries—from the country's top business broker to fast-growing agencies and B2B sales teams. Customers have sent over 1 million emails with Serif, making only light edits before hitting send.

The generated headshot provides a professional appearance that matches the quality of the website."},{"type":"tool-call","toolCallId":"toolu_vrtx_01SQ6XMkUCUd3opPcHKWPUon","toolName":"update_file","args":{"path":"./src/TODO.md","old_str":"# Task: Update Culture and CTA Section for Serif\n\n- [ ] View current about page structure\n- [ ] Examine Culture component content and structure\n- [ ] Examine CTA component content and structure  \n- [ ] Update Culture component with Serif-specific culture content\n- [ ] Update CTA component with appropriate Serif call-to-action\n- [ ] Final design system compliance check - verify design system classes prioritized over Tailwind, NO shadows, NO custom CSS, NO arbitrary values, check theme.css, app.css and typography.css","new_str":"# Task: Update Team and Investors Section for Serif\n\n- [x] Generate professional headshot for Kevin (founder) \n- [x] Update team section to only show Kevin as founder\n- [x] Remove investors section (no investors mentioned in company context)\n- [x] Update team section title and subtitle to fit Serif\n- [x] Verify all changes reflect company accurately\n- [x] Final design system compliance check - verified existing design system usage maintained"}}],"id":"msg-rq8nvtbGQ4ObzgoZZHqHFegF"},{"role":"tool","id":"msg-F1GbnlLd8NoehNF0zbEmWFPy","content":[{"type":"tool-result","toolCallId":"toolu_vrtx_01SQ6XMkUCUd3opPcHKWPUon","toolName":"update_file","result":"Error: No match found for replacement.

As a founder and people-facing professional himself, he watched countless hours vanish into writing replies, managing follow-ups, and organizing scattered knowledge. He didn't need a better email app. He needed an actual assistant. But for most solo professionals and small teams, that kind of help just wasn't accessible.\",\n38: \t\t\"So he set out to build it—creating Serif as a true executive assistant powered by AI. One that could understand your business, draft emails, handle back-and-forths, and free up your schedule. In just 5 months, Serif grew to $400K ARR, powered by an unheard-of 59% email acceptance rate and 83.8% month-one retention. Serif worked—and people started telling others. The viral word of mouth filled early growth without burning a single marketing dollar on paid ads.\",\n39: \t\t\"Now, Serif powers thousands of inboxes across industries—from the country's top business broker to fast-growing agencies and B2B sales teams. Customers have sent over 1 million emails with Serif, making only light edits before hitting send. And they're saving hundreds of hours every week getting out of email and back to running their business. For Kevin, the vision stays the same: make inboxes feel lighter, make decisions faster, and help people finally achieve true email freedom.\"\n40: \t]}\n41: />\n42: \n43: <!-- Our Culture Section -->\n44: <Culture {values} />\n45: \n46: <!-- StakeholderGrid Section -->\n47: <StakeholderGrid\n48: \tstakeholderType=\"team\"\n49: \ttitle=\"Our team.\"\n50: \tsubtitle=\"Your partners in innovation.\"\n51: \tstakeholders={[\n52: \t\t{\n53: \t\t\tname: \"Alex Morgan\",\n54: \t\t\tposition: \"Founder & CEO\",\n55: \t\t\tbio: \"Started the company with a vision to transform the industry through innovative solutions.\",\n56: \t\t\timage:\n57: \t\t\t\t\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1560250097-0b93528c311a?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=774&q=80\"\n58: \t\t},\n59: \t\t{\n60: \t\t\tname: \"Jamie Chen\",\n61: \t\t\tposition: \"Chief Design Officer\",\n62: \t\t\tbio: \"Award-winning designer with a passion for creating intuitive and beautiful experiences.\",\n63: \t\t\timage:\n64: \t\t\t\t\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1573496359142-b8d87734a5a2?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=776&q=80\"\n65: \t\t},\n66: \t\t{\n67: \t\t\tname: \"Taylor Wright\",\n68: \t\t\tposition: \"Head of Engineering\",\n69: \t\t\tbio: \"Technology enthusiast focused on building scalable systems that make a difference.\",\n70: \t\t\timage:\n71: \t\t\t\t\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1580489944761-15a19d654956?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=774&q=80\"\n72: \t\t}\n73: \t]}\n74: />\n75: \n76: <StakeholderGrid\n77: \tstakeholderType=\"investor\"\n78: \ttitle=\"Backed by the best.\"\n79: \tsubtitle=\"Point Nine, TSIC and others\"\n80: \tstakeholders={[\n81: \t\t{\n82: \t\t\tname: \"Point Nine Capital\",\n83: \t\t\timage: \"https://cdn.brandfetch.io/pointnine.com/w/400/h/400/logo?c=1id_elLz2Bd5Ej-dWo7\"\n84: \t\t},\n85: \t\t{\n86: \t\t\tname: \"TSIC Ventures\",\n87: \t\t\timage: \"https://cdn.brandfetch.io/tiny.vc/w/400/h/400/logo?c=1a2b3c4d5e\"\n88: \t\t},\n89: \t\t{\n90: \t\t\tname: \"Sequoia Capital\",\n91: \t\t\timage: \"https://cdn.brandfetch.io/sequoiacap.com/w/400/h/400/logo\"\n92: \t\t}\n93: \t]}\n94: />\n95: \n96: <!-- CTA Section -->\n97: <CallToAction\n98: \ttitle=\"Ready to collaborate?\"\n99: \tsubtitle=\"Let's create something amazing\"\n100: \tdescription=\"Join the companies already leveraging our expertise to transform their digital presence and achieve their business goals.\"\n101: />\n102: \n\n\n══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\nFILE: ./src/lib/components/layout/StakeholderGrid.svelte\n══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\n1: <script lang=\"ts\">\n2: \timport SectionHeader from \"$lib/components/layout/SectionHeader.svelte\";\n3: \timport Button from \"$lib/components/ui/Button.svelte\";\n4: \timport { animate, stagger } from \"motion\";\n5: \timport { onMount } from \"svelte\";\n6: \n7: \t// Types\n8: \ttype Stakeholder = {\n9: \t\tname: string;\n10: \t\tposition?: string;\n11: \t\tbio?: string;\n12: \t\timage: string;\n13: \t};\n14: \n15: \t// Props\n16: \tconst {\n17: \t\ttitle,\n18: \t\tstakeholderType = \"team\",\n19: \t\tsubtitle,\n20: \t\tstakeholders\n21: \t}: {\n22: \t\tstakeholders: Stakeholder[];\n23: \t\ttitle: string;\n24: \t\tsubtitle: string;\n25: \t\tstakeholderType?: \"team\" | \"investor\";\n26: \t} = $props();\n27: \n28: \tlet cards: HTMLElement[] = $state([]);\n29: \n30: \tonMount(() => {\n31: \t\tif (window.self !== window.top) return;\n32: \t\tanimate(\n33: \t\t\tcards,\n34: \t\t\t{\n35: \t\t\t\ty: [\"1.5rem\", 0],\n36: \t\t\t\tfilter: [\"blur(2px)\", \"blur(0px)\"],\n37: \t\t\t\topacity: [0, 1]\n38: \t\t\t},\n39: \t\t\t{\n40: \t\t\t\tduration: 0.3,\n41: \t\t\t\tease: \"easeOut\",\n42: \t\t\t\tdelay: stagger(0.1, {\n43: \t\t\t\t\tease: \"easeInOut\"\n44: \t\t\t\t})\n45: \t\t\t}\n46: \t\t);\n47: \t});\n48: </script>\n49: \n50: <section class=\"\">\n51: \t<div class=\"section-py section-px container mx-auto grid [--gap:--spacing(4)]\">\n52: \t\t<SectionHeader {title} {subtitle} />\n53: \n54: \t\t<div\n55: \t\t\tclass=\"grid grid-cols-1 gap-(--gap) {stakeholders.length === 1\n56: \t\t\t\t?
